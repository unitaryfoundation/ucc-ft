    "The checker returned `False`, indicating the circuit fails the fault tolerance requirements! This seems like a contradiction with the results in the paper, so let's dig a little further. We see that the checker found that 3 injected errors that broke fault tolerance came after the last CNOT gate, and correspond to an `X` and `Z` error on qubit 6 and a `Z` error on qubit 7. Note that even though these are two qubits with errors, this correspond to one faulty operation (the CNOT). From the strict fault tolerance definition used by the checker, for this distance 3 code, 1 fault cannot lead to more than 1 error on the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the dilemma --this looks like a weight-2 error, so how did the paper claim fault tolerance? Well, it turns out this weight-2 error is correctable by the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, looking back at the stabilizers, we see as a CSS code, each stabilizer is either all $X$ or all $Z$ operators and each is able to detect errors of the other variety (i.e. $X$ stabilizers detects phase errors $Z$). But these checks are independent, so they can be jointly detected and corrected. In other words, this means that any product of single $X$ and a single $Z$ error is correctable even if together that is a weight-2 error. The error here (ignoring the irrelevant global phase) is $X_6 Z_6 Z_7$. So the $X_6$ can be handled by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about $Z_6 Z_7$? This looks a correlated two-qubit error that is not separable into single qubit errors. Well, turns out it is equivalent to a single-qubit error under this code. An error $E$ is equivalent to an error $E'$ if it's action on the stabilized state is the same, $E\\psi\\rangle = E'\\psi\\rangle$. If $E = P_i P_j$ on qubits $i$ and $j$, $E'=P_k$ could be an equivalent weight-1 error on qubit $k$ if we can find an operator $S$ of the stabilizer group such that $ES = E'$,\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P_iP_j |\\psi\\rangle = P_iP_j S |\\psi\\rangle = P_k |\\psi\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "From the stabilizers above, we see this is true for the last stabilizer $S = Z_6 Z_7 Z_8$. So $Z_6Z_7$ is equilavent to a $Z_8$ error on this code, and can be corrected alongside the $X_6$ error. Note we've switched to 0-based qubit indicices in this paragraph, versus the 1-based indices in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why did the fault checker flag this? Let's go back to the definition of fault tolerance used by the checker. From Definition 6.1 in the fault checker [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14380), a state preparation circuit gadget is fault tolerant if for any $s$-fault instantiation of the gadget such that $s \\leq t$, the prepared state has at most $s$ errors. Here $t=1$, $s=1$ (just one faulty CNOT), but the prepared state has 2 errors. Even though the $t=1$ code _can_ correct the two errors in this case, that is not the definition used in the checker, which focuses purely on error propagation relative to $t$. This makes sense as a conservative approach, where each gadget independently conforms to the single threshold of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A future direction for the tool is to consider alternate definitions for fault tolerance to treat this case differently.\n"
