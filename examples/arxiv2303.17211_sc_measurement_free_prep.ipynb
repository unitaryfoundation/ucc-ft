    "First, looking back at the stabilizers, we see as a CSS code, each stabilizer is either all $X$ or all $Z$ operators and each is able to detect errors of the other variety (i.e. $X$ stabilizers detects phase errors $Z$). But these checks are independent, so they can be jointly detected and corrected. In other words, this means that any product of single $X$ and a single $Z$ error is correctable even if together that is a weight-2 error. The error here (ignoring the irrelevant global phase) is $X_7 Z_7 Z_8$. So the $X_7$ can be handled. \n",

An error $E$ is equivalent to an error $E'$ if it's action on the stabilized state is the same, e.g. $E\\psi\\rangle = E'\\psi\\rangle$. If $E = P_i P_j$ on qubits $i$ and $j$, $E'=P_k$ could be a weight-1 error on qubit $k$ if we can find an operator $S$ of the stabilizer group such that $ES = E'$,\n",

    "\n",
    "So why did the fault checker flag this? Let's go back to the definition of fault tolerance used by the checker. From Definition 6.1 in the fault checker [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14380), a state preparation circuit gadget is fault tolerant if for any $s$-fault instantiation of the gadget such that $s \\leq t$, the prepared state has at most $s$ errors. Here $t=1$, $s=1$ (just one faulty CNOT), but the prepared state has 2 errors. Even though the $t=1$ code _can_ correct the two errors in this case, that is not the definition used in the checker, which focuses purely on error propagation relative to $t$. This makes sense as a conservative approach, where each gadget independently conforms to the single threshold of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps a future direction for the tool is to consider alternate definitions for fault tolerance to treat this case differently.\n"
