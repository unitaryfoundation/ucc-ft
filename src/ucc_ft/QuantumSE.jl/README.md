# Verifying Fault Tolerance of Quantum Error Correction Codes

## Prerequisite

* `docker` is required to perform artifact evaluation

## Build

1. Build and run the corresponding docker image. It will handle all dependencies and packages:

```
docker build -t vftqecc .
docker run -it vftqecc
```

2. Inside docker, you will be at the project directory `/workspace/QuantumSE.jl`. Install necessary Julia packages by using the following script.

```
julia instantiate.jl
```

Then, follow the **Case Study** section to test different examples.

## Case Study 
### Cat State Preparation

The following steps produce the verification results of cat state preparation shown in Fig. 5 in the paper.

Run `example/CatPreparation.jl` with one parameter. The parameter is the number of faults to be tolerated, taking value in $[1, 2, 3, \ldots]$. After the run is completed, the last two lines of output are the verification result ("Pass" or "Fail") and the running time. For example:

When the number of faults no more than $2$, it is fault-tolerant. For example, run
```
julia example/CatPreparation.jl 2
```
Then the results should be like
```
>>> Pass!
Cat State Preparation, num_faults=2, time=2.1842598915100098
```

When the number of faults is larger than $2$, it is non-fault-tolerant. For example, run
```
julia example/CatPreparation.jl 3
```
Then the results should be like
```
>>> Fail!
Cat State Preparation, num_faults=3, time=2.1932621002197266
```

### Fault Tolerance Verification

The results of fault tolerance verification (see Table 1 in the paper) is produced by the following steps.

Run `example/ColorCode.jl` or `example/RotatedSurfaceCode.jl` or `example/ToricCode.jl` with two parameters. The first parameter is the type of gadget, taking value in [`prep`, `cnot`, `meas`, `ec`]. The second parameter is the code distance, taking value in odd numbers (Color code only supports distance $3$ and $5$). 

Here are some examples:

```
julia example/ColorCode.jl ec 5
```
and
```
julia example/RotatedSurfaceCode.jl meas 3
```
and
```
julia example/ToricCode.jl prep 3
```

Then, Run `example/QuantumReedMullerCode.jl` without parameters. 
```
julia example/QuantumReedMullerCode.jl
```

After the run is completed, the last two lines of output are the verification result (should be "Pass") and the running time. For example:
```
>>> Pass!
Color Code, ec, [n,k,d]=[17,1,5], time=20.980690174102783
```

For reader's convenience, we provide here the parameters corresponding to the results in Table 1.
|  QECC   | [n,k,d] | Prep. | CNOT | Meas. | EC | 
| -------- | ------- | ------ | ------| ------| ------ |
| Color Code  |  [7,1,3] | prep 3 | cnot 3| meas 3 | ec 3|
| Color Code  |  [17,1,5] | prep 5 | cnot 5| meas 5 | ec 5|
| Rotated Surface Code |   [9,1,3] |  prep 3 | cnot 3| meas 3 | ec 3|
| Rotated Surface Code |   [25,1,5] |  prep 5 | cnot 5| meas 5 | ec 5|
| Rotated Surface Code |   [49,1,7] |  prep 7 | cnot 7| meas 7 | ec 7|
| Toric Code | [18,2,3] |  prep 3 | cnot 3| meas 3 | ec 3|
| Toric Code | [50,2,5] |  prep 5 | cnot 5| meas 5 | ec 5|
| Quantum Reed-Muller Code | [15,1,3]  |  N.A. | N.A. | N.A. | no parameter |
